-- Here We Create Three Schma
/* { HOW SCHEMA'S HELP US ? }
   In SQL, a schema is a blueprint or structure that organizes database objects like tables,
   views, and stored procedures. 
   It provides a way to group related objects, enhance security, and manage databases more efficiently. 
   Schemas act as namespaces, preventing naming conflicts and enabling logical grouping of database 
   elements;
